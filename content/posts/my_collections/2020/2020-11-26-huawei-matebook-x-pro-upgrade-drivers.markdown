First of all I am very happy with the performance and stability. This is my first personal windows 10 usage it needed 2 times resetting(we used to call it format but it changed obviously) after windows updates, Windows is not very famous about it`s stability, so I learn how to backup and make sure everything is okay in case of system failure.

And I saw this windows update page around a month ago
![Windows update](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/604405/100381796-ac67e780-3011-11eb-8d07-9f1b45765a71.png)

And there is Huawei pc manager installed already and it was not telling any driver updates

I was afraid to install it because as you know any windows fail will need resetting and reinstall, it takes longer and I am working from home :) anyway I search in Reddit and could not find anyone telling anything about it. 2 days ago I contacted with Huawei support, they suggested hardware scan and see if it brings the updates but if it does not, they said "there should not be any issue downloading updates from the official source."

And today I finally installed the drivers and my laptop still works I am happy,

Now I need to figure out [very strange windows 10 network problem](https://answers.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/forum/all/win10-internet-connection-problem/59141108-4477-4124-928b-3cc8ea63a322?auth=1), it is so much fun to use windows, I wish it had better community.
