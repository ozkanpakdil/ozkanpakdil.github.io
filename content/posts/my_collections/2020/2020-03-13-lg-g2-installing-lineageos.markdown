title: LineageOS installation on my old lg g2
---
My old lg g2 had lineageOS 14 installed already. But it was showing the info about new version and I should upgrade it. My first attempt failed miserably. And I brick my phone.

When I started my phone it was showing only LG logo and it was in boot loop. They call it boot loop but actually it was not really booting up. Anyway yesterday I found https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2797190 and finally installed the old LG android and it started working again. you can find the kdz here https://forum.xda-developers.com/showthread.php?t=2432476

Then I started to install lineage OS from scratch and fallowed https://wiki.lineageos.org/devices/d802/install and finally saw lineageOS 16 on my phone but there was no google apps. They call it Gapps. Anyway I tried to install couple of different version and failed couple of times finally I installed open_gapps-arm-9.0-full-20200311.zip and now my old lg g2 has the latest android I can put :)

Main reason was for me to install Google Fit on my phone. In old lg version of android, google fit was look like "not compatible" with the device. But with latest lineageOS it is installed. Now everything in order and I can move on to developing my latest android app :)
