title: Google App Engine is it expensive for me
---

I have been using a dedicated server for a very long time. I tried a cloud solution around 6 years ago. It was very expensive, and this year I decided to test cloud again. I have a spring boot application which needs 2gb ram and very small cpu usage, not much IO. I pay 30 euro(25.76 Pound sterling) for monthly dedicated server from hetzner server auction https://www.hetzner.com/sb 

And I registered for Google Cloud and used AppEngine https://cloud.google.com/appengine took me couple of hours to test and start my app, and I have 200 pounds(gift) from google cloud for the new user

It means I already passed my monthly expenses compared to hetzner. So google cloud is more expensive than a regular dedicated server. 

In case you wonder about the traffic load, which is not very high,

So the last 7 days are from google app engine.
