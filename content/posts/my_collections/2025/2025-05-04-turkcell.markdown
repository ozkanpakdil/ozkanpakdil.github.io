## Prologue: The Era of WebLogic and Apache Mod_WebLogic

It was 2012. Turkcell, Turkey’s largest mobile operator, had 15 million subscribers, and the pressure was on. As part of the operations team for www.turkcell.com.tr, I managed a labyrinth of infrastructure: 10 strong
linux servers which had Weblogic installed humming behind Apache mod_weblogic proxies, serving dynamic requests while Apache handled static content. The e-commerce platform, Turkcell Shop, was my responsibility-where a
single GC pause during peak traffic could mean thousands of failed transactions and angry customers.

Back then, Java ruled enterprise systems, but garbage collection was a double-edged sword. Tuning JVMs like orchestra conductors-desperate to balance throughput, latency, and stability.

## The GC Wars of 2012

### The Problem: CMS GC and the 8-Second Pauses

Our initial setup used the **Concurrent Mark-Sweep (CMS) collector**, the go-to for low-latency systems pre-G1. But as traffic spiked during holiday sales or new iPhone launches, CMS struggled. Major GC pauses hit **8-10
seconds**, causing timeouts in Apache’s mod_weblogic connections. Customers saw spinning wheels at checkout. Our Splunk dashboards flashed red.

### The Load Test Revelation

Armed with **JMeter**, we simulated 10,000 concurrent users on the e-commerce app. The results were brutal:

- **CMS**: 92% throughput, but 99th percentile response times of **12 seconds** during GC.
- **Parallel GC**: Better throughput, but even longer pauses-**15 seconds** during full GC.

The team debated: *“Do we accept pauses for throughput, or chase lower latency?”*

## Discovering G1-The “Garbage-First” Gamble

### Why G1?

In 2012, G1 was still experimental (Java 7u4), but its promise of **predictable pauses** and **region-based collection** intrigued us. Unlike CMS, G1 avoided fragmentation by incrementally compacting the heap. For a
system with **12GB heaps** and mixed workloads (HTTP sessions, order processing), this felt like a fit.

### The Pitch to Leadership

Convincing management to adopt an “unproven” GC was tough. I built a case:

- **Predictability**: G1’s `MaxGCPauseMillis` let us target 200ms pauses.
- **Scalability**: Regions allowed better heap utilization for Turkcell Shop’s volatile traffic.
- **Future-Proofing**: Oracle’s roadmap hinted G1 would replace CMS.

After weeks of Splunk-fueled debates, we got a green light for a **staged rollout**.

## Tuning G1 for 15 Million Subscribers

### The Configuration Wars

We started with defaults, but G1’s early days were rocky. Full GCs still occurred when the heap filled too fast. Our tuning arsenal:

```shell  
-XX:+UseG1GC  
-XX:MaxGCPauseMillis=200  
-XX:InitiatingHeapOccupancyPercent=35  # Trigger GC earlier  
-XX:G1ReservePercent=15  # Buffer for promotion failures  
```

### Splunk Dashboards: Our GC Crystal Ball

We piped GC logs into Splunk, tracking:

- **Heap occupancy** trends before/after sales.
- **Promotion rates** (Young → Old generation).
- **Pause times** correlated with customer complaints.

One midnight, a dashboard alert caught a humongous allocation-a 50MB XML payload clogging a G1 region. We fixed it by splitting the payload and adding:

```shell
-XX:G1HeapRegionSize=16M  
```

### Legacy and Lessons

Why G1 Won

- **Adaptability:** Handled Turkcell’s mix of short-lived HTTP requests and long-lived sessions.
- **Tunability:** Parameters like MaxGCPauseMillis aligned with SLAs.
- **Splunk + JMeter:** Data-driven decisions beat gut feelings.

### The Human Factor

As a developer-turned-SRE, I learned:

- **Collaborate:** Bridged dev/ops teams by sharing Splunk dashboards.
- **Obsess Over Logs:** A GC log anomaly often hid a code smell.
- **Test Relentlessly:** JMeter scripts mirrored real user rage.

### Epilogue: Beyond Turkcell

When I left Turkcell in 2015, G1 was becoming mainstream. Today, ZGC and Shenandoah handle terabyte heaps, but G1’s principles-predictability, incremental compaction-live on.

To engineers battling GC pauses: Your logs tell a story. Listen to them.
