I bought this laptop about 2 months ago. and I directly installed xubuntu. I was not aware but F keys stop working. one day I was looking a site and wanted to see the html dom details and hit the F12. and my wireless stop working. then I realized my function key is like pressed and my F keys was not working.

I researched a lot but could not find anyway to fix this until roday :) you just need to disable it like this <a rel="nofollow"  href="http://h30434.www3.hp.com/t5/Other-Notebook-PC-Questions/How-to-unlock-the-fn-function-key/td-p/1050665">link</a>
