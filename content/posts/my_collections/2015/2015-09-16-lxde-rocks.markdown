title: I moved to lxde
---
I installed linux into this computer around 3 months ago. and I am loving it. as long as debian in my pc I am happy :) the other day I <a href="/laptop/2015/09/15/HP%20pavilion%20dv7%20f%20keys.html">disabled fn key from BIOS</a> and suspend started working also. I am not sure which one solved the problem. turning to lxde or that bios thing but still I am happy about this. 

because closing the lid and opening it and not finding X was frustrating. and I had a lot of restarts because of that. now it is working like it suppose to.
