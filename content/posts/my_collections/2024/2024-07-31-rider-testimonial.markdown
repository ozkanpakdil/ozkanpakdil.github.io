I used eclipse 10 years and moved to IntelliJ in 2017 since then no turning back, a true Java IDE, perfect refactoring also any editing capabilities, and in 2024 I moved to Redgate Monitor and C# after 18 years of Java I was scared but thanks to JetBrains Rider, when I open the Rider it asked me what shortcut set do I choose, and there was IntelliJ option, I chose it and jumped into the code and adoption time was incredible, in days I understand how is the structure (over 180 projects under multiple solution and thousands of classes/files) and started contributing the project.

I am also an open source developer and use IntelliJ and all products in my personal time, and it has been a pleasure to work with JetBrains, thank you for the great product, and please keep up the good work.

Furthermore, I can suggest anyone who is learning Java just use IntelliJ, it will help you to understand the environment faster, otherwise Java can be hard to comprehend because there's no one way to do anything, even for building, Java has Gradle and Maven and old Ant and if a new starter sees where was “javac” went they get confused, I always say Java as language is very simple, but environment is hard to swallow.
