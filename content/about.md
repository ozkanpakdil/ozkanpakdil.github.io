As the title of this site says, I'm a seasoned software engineer with a professional journey spanning back
to 2004. Throughout my career, I've delved into a multitude of projects and companies, honing my skills across
various technologies. While my primary expertise lies in Java development, I've also ventured into diverse areas such as
mobile web projects, where I've tackled tasks like crafting solutions
in [Wireless Markup Language (WML)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wireless_Markup_Language) for mobile websites and
mastering the intricacies of [HTTP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HTTP) for SMS gateways. Or [ActionScript]() and flash
for preparing some banner.

Consider me a full-stack developer; I'm well-versed in all aspects of software development, from crafting intuitive user
interfaces to optimizing backend performance and managing databases. With a knack for designing and delivering N-tier
applications, Java has been my trusty companion, although I've dabbled in .NET on occasion.

I have extensive experience across backend, database, server-side development, UI, UX. As a Linux enthusiast,
I've enjoyed coding on Linux systems since 2008, leveraging its capabilities for various projects. My encounters with
challenges often involved the database layer, where I've honed my skills in fine-tuning kernel parameters, especially
related to networking and TCP, for optimal performance. Additionally, I am also 'JVM bender' through my
adeptness in configuring Oracle and IBM JVMs, particularly during the J2EE era with WebLogic and WebSphere, and more
recently with OpenJDK, Tomcat, and Spring Boot.

Below is a list of the tools/libraries and platforms that I've worked with so far.
