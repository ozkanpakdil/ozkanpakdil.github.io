### Availability in numbers

Availability is often quantified by uptime (or downtime) as a percentage of time the service is available.  Availability is generally measured in number of 9s--a service with 99.99% availability is described as having four 9s.

#### 99.9% availability - three 9s

| Duration            | Acceptable downtime|
|---------------------|--------------------|
| Downtime per year   | 8h 45min 57s       |
| Downtime per month  | 43m 49.7s          |
| Downtime per week   | 10m 4.8s           |
| Downtime per day    | 1m 26.4s           |
